	<p> My final goal in the future is to operate a branding design company.
		I would like to be in charge of the application and web page designs by defining logos and symbols of a start-up
		company, plus I would like to work on the concept and direction of the company. I want to enhance a brand's value
		and give a positive image to start-up companies so that consumers can feel comfortable, and that they can trust a
		business. The reason why I applied for the <a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-program-g113">
			Interaction Design and Development Program </a> at George Brown College is
		that I feel the need to study UX Design in order to achieve my final goal, and I want to understand the principles
			of interaction design in depth. <b>I want to become an expert who can work at anytime, anywhere</b> in 10 years. After
		graduating from a Korean college, I have worked as a freelance graphic designer. Even if I do not have an office, I
		could work remotely with my laptop. I can work on a flight, in a cafe, at home and at my friend's company. I do my
		best work when I work independently and when I have a positive mindset.
		Being a professional freelancer requires many skills, so after I have completed the program, I would like to expand
		my work experience as an UX designer for a Canadian company. </p>

	<div class="container2">Currently, many start-up companies are interested in app and web development because smartphones have become
		mainstream. They put a lot of effort into creating company webpages and apps. Also, having their own platform is not
		an option,
		it is mandatory. In addition, the smart watch is becoming more common in society, and many people try to manage
		themselves, their
		time, and activities through a smart watch. I also use an Apple Watch for managing my plans and health and I am
		attempting to make an application using the
		Xcode program that fits my lifestyle. I also like to find and purchase useful smartphone and MacBook applications,
		but I want to make my own applications because it is hard to find one that satisfies my specific needs.</p>

	<p><i>I have dreamed of becoming a graphic designer since I was in high school</i>, but I studied fine arts and art theory
		for personal reasons. I thought that I could adapt well because it is a similar field, but design and fine art is
		completely different. I learned graphic design through self-study, and I made my portfolio to showcase my work.
		Although I have worked for several companies as a designer, I started self-studying on YouTube basic web codings
		such as HTML and CSS <i>(I want to learn more things that I could not learn by myself in the information architecture
			class)</i> because many companies want someone who can work with basic coding and various programs as well as the
		ability to design. Companies often will desire employees who are not only technical but creative. I was interested
		in basic coding classes and I was intrigued by solving commands that did not work well. I want to learn more about
		UX design in a broader context so that I can expand my skills and also help others.</p>
